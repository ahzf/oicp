## Introduction

### The Hubject Platform

The goal of the “Hubject B2B Service Platform (HBS)” is to enable the electric mobility market by providing an information and transactional gateway for businesses such as charging infrastructure providers, mobility service providers and vehicle manufacturers.

The platform enabler functions include: 

*	Ensuring the interoperability of the public and semi-public infrastructure by promoting accepted standards  within the network and open business user interfaces to the platform 
*	Simplification of authentication and authorization procedures through a trustworthy instance as well as safekeeping of sensitive data through the uncoupling of personal data and anonymous user data 
*	Automation of contract-based business relationships between power suppliers, car manufacturers, infrastructure service providers as well as further mobility business partners. 
*	B2B information service for the realization of advanced services within the areas of energy management, traffic management, vehicle reservations, intelligent charging, car sharing and intermodal mobility

### The Emobility Service Provider (EMP)
As an EMP you profit from our solution CONNECT. It allows you to offer EV drivers access to public charging infrastructure across national borders. Your customers will be able to identify any available charging point through our easily recognizable compatibility symbol, the intercharge logo. By getting connected to the intercharge network your customers will be able to use every charge point of all participating CPOs via eRoaming.

For this purpose, you need to be onboarded to the eRoaming platform HBS (Hubject Brokering System). The HBS functions as an open emobility market place, which creates an open synergetic network that everyone profits from in the end.

In general, there are two different possibilities to be connected to the HBS as an EMP.

##### Offline EMP: 
The so called offline EMP has no real-time connection for authorization to the Hubject platform. This means that authentication data for the authorization MUST be sent and stored on the Hubject platform via the eRoamingPushAuthenticationData. The HBS will authorize charging sessions locally on the platform. Nevertheless, there can be a real-time connection for pulling dynamic POI data. Furthermore, the CDRs, resulting from each charging session, will not be directly forwarded to the EMP but will also be stored on the HBS. The EMP can then download these CDRs on demand via the eRoamingGetChargeDetailRecords service.

##### Online EMP:
The so called online EMP is fully connected to the HBS via a real-time interface. This means that authorization requests are forwarded to the EMP’s system in real-time. To ensure the online authorization, the EMP MUST implement the holistic authorization web service. Furthermore, the CDRs created for each charging session will be directly forwarded to the EMP’s system. Therefore, online EMP’s MUST implement the eRoamingChargeDetailRecord service.
### Scope

The information exchange between Hubject and CPO systems is entirely based on web service communication. This document describes the relevant service interfaces for CPO. The Open InterCharge Protocol (OICP) is the most widely implemented communication standard between EMP and CPO systems.

The information exchange is, in most cases, based on contractual relationships between EMPs and CPOs. In these cases, Hubject only processes service requests if there is a valid contract for the requested service. How EMPs and CPOs manage their service contracts is out of the scope of this document because the contract management aspects of the platform are used via a GUI-based system component.

### Conventions

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY` and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).  

### Overview

The following diagram gives an overview of all service operation messages that can be exchanged between Hubject and the corresponding EMP, respectively CPO systems.

The chapter [Services and Operations](02_EMP_Services_and_Operations.asciidoc) introduces the supported web services and the corresponding service operations in detail and defines the messages that will be exchanged between Hubject and partner systems. Chapter [Data Types](03_EMP_Data_Types.asciidoc) specifies the data types of the messages inclueing details the required Data Types. Furthermore, every service is described in detail by a business process diagram, which is part of the appendix.

### Release management  

Hubject intends to pursue a release frequency; whereby, a new update of the OICP can be done within a time frame of two years with the HBS. The frequency of releases to be expected in the future should however not result in additional implementation complexity for partners, since each new release will lead to a new version of the affected services that will run in parallel to the current service version. Consequently, partners do not need to perform an upgrade with each new release, but will rather have the flexibility to choose which of the available valid service versions they wish to use. Service validity is dependent on the OICP version with which they are released (i.e. service versions available in deprecated OICP versions are only considered invalid and will not be supported by the HBS). Only service versions available in active OICP versions shall be supported. Each OICP version MUST be supported for two years by the HBS. 

See below for an example of the implications of the HBS release management approach (note: the dates and content in the diagram below are strictly meant for explanation purposes only. This is not to be considered as an official communication of release dates):

![OICP Versions Release](images/oicp_version_release_example.png)

* Service versions: in this example, assuming the current date is October 15th 2021, only service versions highlighted in green will be supported by the HBS; whereas services highlighted in grey will no longer be supported, since these service versions are only available in deprecated OICP versions (i.e. the OICP versions highlighted in red). Consequently, partners can choose one of 3 valid service versions to implement for “Service A”, and one of 2 valid versions for “Service B” and “Service C”. 
* OICP versions: the OICP versions highlighted in red will not be supported by the HBS assuming the current date is 15th October 2021 since they are old therefore deprecated. Also, as depicted in the above example and in contrast to the HBS release management approach, more than two OICP versions can be supported simultaneously going forward.

All partners using the HBS `MUST` indicate the OICP version they are currently running in their system (i.e. OICP version being used in the communication with the HBS). On the database level however, the current specifications are to be implemented in all systems, i.e. new mandatory fields should be filled with a value.

### OICP protocol version and service versions

Beginning with OICP 2.1, service endpoints are versioned individually and independent of the OICP version. The table below therefore gives an overview of all web services and their current version within OICP version 2.3.  

|Service |Version     |
|:---|:---:|
|eRoamingAuthorization|2.1   |   
|eRoamingChargeDetailRecord|2.2   |
|eRoamingAuthenticationData|2.1   |
|eRoamingReservation|1.1   | 
|eRoamingEVSEData|2.3   | 
|eRoamingEVSEStatus|2.1  | 
|eRoamingDynamicPricing|1.0   | 
|eRoamingChargingNotifications|1.1  |
